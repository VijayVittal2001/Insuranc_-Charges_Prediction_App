# Insurance Charges Predictor using XGBoost & Gradio

This project is a simple machine learning web application that predicts an individual's insurance charges based on their demographic and health-related features. The model uses the `insurance.csv` dataset and is trained using the powerful `XGBoostRegressor`.

The user interface is built with **Gradio**, allowing real-time predictions based on dropdown inputs.
